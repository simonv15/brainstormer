## Raw Idea

I want to create a project that's a kit for AI coding agent like Claude Code, Codex, etc. It's follow the "Spec-Driven development" with general workflow "Explore->Plan->Code" and have feature context management intelligence (token efficient but still focus on correct context). User can use the kit by slash commands (SKILLS)

## Initial Understanding

A developer toolkit that gives AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) a structured spec-driven workflow — Explore, Plan, Code — with smart context management that keeps token usage efficient while pulling in the right context. Users interact with the kit through slash-command-based skills.
